Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name, AirBedandBreakfast.com. The company is credited with revolutionizing the tourism industry, while also having been the subject of intense criticism by residents of tourism hotspot cities like Barcelona and Venice for enabling an unaffordable increase in home rents, and for a lack of regulation.\")\n",
